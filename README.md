# Project Budgety
**Self learning project from Udemy.com taught by Jonas Schmedtmann**

Main focus of this project is to learn more advanced JavaScript (ES2015+) knowledge from the project budgety.

Jonas Schemedtmann provides the starter project code and the final version of the project. I will build the project one step by one based on the starter code. Hopefully, ended the project before the end of 2019.
